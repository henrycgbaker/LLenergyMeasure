### Prompt

```
You are a code analyser doing PASS 2 (verification) of multi-pass
invariant extraction. PASS 1 already extracted invariants from
transformers v4.57.3 for ONE chunk of source. Your job is to
REVIEW each emitted invariant against the source and flag any that
look WRONG.

INPUT 1 - PASS 1 EXTRACTED INVARIANTS (the candidate list):

invariants:
- id: transformers_early_stopping_set_when_num_beams_one
  severity: dormant
  match:
    engine: transformers
    fields:
      transformers.sampling.num_beams:
        present: true
        not_equal: 1
  invariant_under_test: GenerationConfig.validate flags early_stopping set when num_beams=1
- id: transformers_length_penalty_set_when_num_beams_one
  severity: dormant
  match:
    engine: transformers
    fields:
      transformers.sampling.num_beams:
        present: true
        not_equal: 1
  invariant_under_test: GenerationConfig.validate flags length_penalty set when num_beams=1


INPUT 2 - THE SOURCE PASS 1 READ:

=== CONTEXT: GenerationConfig.validate() ===
This is one logical section. Other sections are mined separately. Focus only on validations visible in THIS section.

IMPORTANT: Each `if self.<field> is not None and <cond>:` block must produce ONE invariant per <field>. Do NOT collapse multiple field checks into one invariant keyed by `do_sample` or `num_beams`. Each per-field check is its OWN dormant invariant. Key by the FIELD being flagged (temperature, top_p, min_p, etc.), NOT by the gating field (do_sample / num_beams).


=== SOURCE: validate() section 8 (2.2._detect_beam_only_parameterization_when_not_in_beam_mode) ===
# 2.2. detect beam-only parameterization when not in beam mode
        if self.num_beams == 1:
            single_beam_wrong_parameter_msg = (
                "`num_beams` is set to 1. However, `{flag_name}` is set to `{flag_value}` -- this flag is only used "
                "in beam-based generation modes. You should set `num_beams>1` or unset `{flag_name}`."
            )
            if self.early_stopping is not False:
                minor_issues["early_stopping"] = single_beam_wrong_parameter_msg.format(
                    flag_name="early_stopping", flag_value=self.early_stopping
                )
            if self.length_penalty is not None and self.length_penalty != 1.0:
                minor_issues["length_penalty"] = single_beam_wrong_parameter_msg.format(
                    flag_name="length_penalty", flag_value=self.length_penalty
                )



OUTPUT FORMAT: a YAML document with TWO sections:

confirmed:
- <id-of-pass1-invariant>  # one ID per line, no further detail needed.

flagged:
- id: <id-of-pass1-invariant>
  reason: <one-line: what looks wrong>
  fix: <one of: "drop", "correct_severity:<new-severity>", "correct_predicate:<new-kind>", "correct_kwargs_positive">

RULES:
1. Every PASS 1 invariant MUST appear in EITHER `confirmed` OR `flagged`
   (not both, not neither). If you're unsure, place in `confirmed` (the
   bar for flagging is "obviously wrong against the source").
2. Flag reasons must be CONCRETE - cite the source line that contradicts
   the invariant, or note the specific shape mismatch.
3. NO markdown code fences. NO commentary outside the YAML.
4. First character must be `c` (from `confirmed:`).

CRITERIA FOR FLAGGING:
- Severity wrong: source has `raise ValueError` but invariant says
  `severity: dormant`; or source has `minor_issues[...] = ...` but
  invariant says `severity: error`.
- Predicate wrong: source has `if X.field not in {a, b}: raise`
  but invariant emits `predicate_kind: exact`.
- Kwargs_positive wrong: source's predicate is "value < 0 raises" but
  invariant's kwargs_positive shows `field: 1` (which would NOT trigger).
- Hallucinated: invariant references a field name that does NOT appear
  in the source.

Emit the YAML now:
