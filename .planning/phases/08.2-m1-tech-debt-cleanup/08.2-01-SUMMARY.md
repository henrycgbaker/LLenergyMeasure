phase: 08.2-m1-tech-debt-cleanup
plan: "01"
subsystem: docs
tags: [documentation, verification, traceability, config]

requires:
  - phase: 02-config-system
    provides: UAT results (11/11 pass), SUMMARY frontmatter with requirements-completed lists

provides:
  - Formal Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md confirming all 19 CFG requirements as SATISFIED
  - Updated REQUIREMENTS.md M1 gap closure: CFG-01-10 and CFG-18-26 marked Complete
  - Corrected cli/CLAUDE.md reflecting v2.0 CLI structure (run + config commands only)

affects:
  - REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (M1 gap closure section)
  - 02-config-system phase completeness record

# Phase 8.2 Plan 01: Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Retroactive Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md (11/11 truths, 19 CFG requirements), REQUIREMENTS.md CFG gap closure marked Complete, cli/CLAUDE.md corrected for v2.0 (run + config only)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-27T12:38:01Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-27T12:40:36Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3 (2 committed, 1 local-only)

## Accomplishments

- Created `.planning/phases/02-config-system/02-VERIFICATION.md` — retroactive formal verification of Phase 2 using existing UAT results (11/11 passed) and SUMMARY frontmatter as evidence. All 19 CFG requirements documented as SATISFIED.
- Updated `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` M1 gap closure table — changed CFG-01–10 and CFG-18–26 from `Pending` to `Complete` with reference to the new VERIFICATION.md.
- Rewrote `src/llenergymeasure/cli/CLAUDE.md` — removed all v1.x references (batch.py, schedule.py, listing.py, lifecycle.py, lem experiment/batch/schedule/datasets commands); now documents only v2.0 structure (run + config + display/).

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Write Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md** - `3f8c43d` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability and fix cli/CLAUDE.md** - `be6914b` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/02-config-system/02-VERIFICATION.md` — 146-line formal verification report (CREATED)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — 2 rows updated from Pending to Complete (MODIFIED)
- `src/llenergymeasure/cli/CLAUDE.md` — rewritten for v2.0; local only, not git-tracked (MODIFIED, local)

## Decisions Made

- **cli/CLAUDE.md not committed**: The `.git/info/exclude` file contains a `CLAUDE.md` pattern that excludes all CLAUDE.md files from git tracking. This is a machine-local exclusion. The file was updated locally and serves its purpose as a navigation aid; no change needed to the exclude configuration.
- **Retroactive verification approach**: Used UAT 11/11 results (02-UAT.md) and SUMMARY `requirements-completed` frontmatter as evidence. No re-execution of tests required — the evidence chain is complete.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

None.

### Other Deviations

**1. cli/CLAUDE.md not committed (git exclude)**
- **Found during:** Task 2 commit
- **Issue:** `.git/info/exclude` contains `CLAUDE.md` pattern, blocking `git add` for any CLAUDE.md file in the repo.
- **Impact:** The correction is in place locally. The file serves as a navigation aid and does not affect runtime behaviour. No CI or functional impact.
- **Decision:** Accept — the exclude pattern is intentional (CLAUDE.md files are personal/agent navigation aids, not production code). File updated locally; commit covers only REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the git exclude deviation documented above.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 8.2 Plan 01 complete — all 19 CFG verification gaps closed
- REQUIREMENTS.md M1 gap closure section is now fully Complete
- Phase 8.2 Plan 02 can proceed (if additional tech debt cleanup plans exist)
