# Phase 02.1 Plan 04: Documentation Refresh Summary

**One-liner:** Updated all documentation to reflect local-first install with PyTorch default and `lem doctor` diagnostics

## What Was Built

Refreshed user-facing documentation to match the new zero-config install experience:

1. **README.md** - Already updated by 02.1-03 with two-path install story
2. **docs/quickstart.md** - Local-first quickstart flow
3. **docs/backends.md** - Environment check section with `lem doctor`
4. **docs/deployment.md** - Direct docker compose workflow

All documentation now:
- Shows `pip install -e .` as default install (PyTorch included)
- References `lem doctor` for environment diagnostics
- Documents Docker as optional for multi-backend campaigns
- Uses standard `docker compose` commands (not `lem docker setup`)
- Zero references to `setup.sh` (being removed)

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Update README.md install section
**Status:** Already completed by agent 02.1-03
**Commit:** 8f9d417 (by parallel agent)

README.md was updated by the parallel agent working on 02.1-03 (make PyTorch default). The changes matched our requirements:
- Two-path install story (local / local+Docker)
- No setup.sh references
- References `lem doctor` for diagnostics

### Task 2: Update quickstart, backends, and deployment docs
**Status:** Complete
**Commit:** 34f55da

Updated three documentation files:

**docs/quickstart.md** (~310 lines):
- Quick start shows `pip install -e .` then `lem doctor`
- Installation options show local-first, Docker for multi-backend
- Removed all `setup.sh` references
- Updated environment variables section

**docs/backends.md** (~890 lines):
- Added "Checking Your Environment" section with `lem doctor` output sample
- Updated backend installation instructions (PyTorch included in base)
- Added `lem doctor` reference for installation verification

**docs/deployment.md** (~418 lines):
- Updated quick setup to show local install + `lem doctor`
- Replaced `setup.sh` with direct docker compose workflow
- Updated environment variables section (manual .env creation)
- Removed all `setup.sh` references from troubleshooting
- Added `lem doctor` to troubleshooting steps

## Verification Results

All verification checks passed:

```bash
# No setup.sh references
$ grep -r 'setup.sh' README.md docs/ | grep -v '.planning' | wc -l
0

# lem doctor documented
$ grep -l 'lem doctor' README.md docs/backends.md
README.md
docs/backends.md

# docker compose documented
$ grep -l 'docker compose' docs/deployment.md
docs/deployment.md

# pip install documented
$ grep -l 'pip install' README.md docs/quickstart.md
README.md
docs/quickstart.md

# No lem docker setup/build
$ grep -r 'lem docker setup' README.md docs/ | wc -l
0
$ grep -r 'lem docker build' README.md docs/ | wc -l
0
```

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Implementation Notes

### Coordination with Parallel Agent

Agent 02.1-03 (make PyTorch default) was running in parallel and committed README.md changes that matched our Task 1 requirements. We verified their changes were correct and proceeded with Task 2 (other documentation files).

### Documentation Strategy

The updated documentation reflects a clear two-path story:

**Path 1: Local install (most users)**
```bash
pip install -e .            # Includes PyTorch
lem doctor                  # Check environment
lem experiment config.yaml  # Run experiment
```

**Path 2: Local + Docker (multi-backend campaigns)**
```bash
pip install -e .                    # Install CLI tool
docker compose build pytorch vllm   # Build needed backends
lem campaign config.yaml            # Auto-dispatches to Docker
```

This matches the zero-config vision where:
- PyTorch "just works" after `pip install`
- Docker is optional, only for multi-backend scenarios
- `lem doctor` provides diagnostic feedback

### lem doctor Integration

All documentation now references `lem doctor` for:
- Post-install verification
- Troubleshooting
- Environment diagnostics

This provides users with a clear, automated way to verify their setup.

## Commits

| Commit | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 34f55da | docs | Update quickstart, backends, and deployment docs |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| README.md | Updated by 02.1-03 | Two-path install story (already done) |
| docs/quickstart.md | 54 lines | Local-first quickstart flow |
| docs/backends.md | 52 lines | Environment check with lem doctor |
| docs/deployment.md | 62 lines | Direct docker compose workflow |

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 02.1-05 (validation docs)** can proceed:
- All user-facing docs updated
- No setup.sh references remain
- lem doctor documented for diagnostics

**Blockers:** None

**Concerns:** None - documentation is consistent and accurate

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] README.md: Two-path install story, no setup.sh references
- [x] docs/quickstart.md: Local-first flow starting with pip install
- [x] docs/backends.md: Environment check section with lem doctor
- [x] docs/deployment.md: Docker setup via docker compose directly
- [x] Zero references to setup.sh across all documentation
- [x] Zero references to lem docker setup/build in documentation
