# Phase 2.3 Plan 04: Verification Checkpoint Summary

**One-liner:** Manual verification of Phase 2.3 features — `lem init`, `lem resume`, webhooks, and unit tests.

## Verification Results

All Phase 2.3 success criteria verified:

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `lem resume` discovers interrupted campaigns | ✓ Verified |
| `lem resume --dry-run` shows what would be resumed | ✓ Verified |
| `lem resume --wipe` clears all state | ✓ Verified |
| `lem init` guided setup wizard works | ✓ Verified |
| `lem init --non-interactive` creates config | ✓ Verified |
| Environment detection shown before prompts | ✓ Verified |
| `lem doctor` runs after config creation | ✓ Verified |
| Webhook notifications configured in UserConfig | ✓ Verified |
| Unit tests pass (41 new tests) | ✓ Verified |
| No regressions (`make check` passes) | ✓ Verified |

## UX Improvements Added During Verification

Based on user feedback, additional improvements were made:

1. **Results directory clarity** — Shows relative path context + resolved absolute path
2. **Docker strategy descriptions** — Explains ephemeral vs persistent tradeoffs
3. **Multi-backend info panel** — Always shown, explains Docker requirement for vLLM/TensorRT
4. **Webhook explanation** — Explains what webhooks do with example URL
5. **Backends display** — Shows which need Docker vs work locally

## Documentation Updates

- README.md updated with `lem init`, `lem resume`, webhook examples
- docs/quickstart.md updated with wizard flow, resume workflow, user config section
